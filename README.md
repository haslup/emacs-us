# Welcome to emacs.us!

I was reading [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) one day and saw a funny story about Google opening up the `.dev` TLD for registration and that someone had registered `vim.dev` and pointed it at the Emacs homepage.  Someone in the comments pointed out that `emacs.dev` was still open if anyone wanted to turn that around.  Of course by the time I saw it that domain was taken and someone had indeed pointed `emacs.dev` to VIM's home page which I found hilarious.

While checking the registration of `emacs.dev` I noticed that `emacs.us` was actually available.  Since I've been a die-hard emacs user for the last 25+ years, I figured it might be fun to register that domain and set something up so that I could write about emacs.

So here it is!  I'm trying out something called [Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) to render the pages from a public [github](https://github.com/haslup/emacs-us) repo I'll use to write in.  I'm guessing if it ever comes up I'll take PR's and whatnot, but I'm not thinking it'll get that big.  Either way, first I'll see if I write things myself before hoping for others.

So that's what this site is... enjoy!
